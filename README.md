### Apple Review Response (Safe Mode)

Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback. The app version submitted for review is a compliance-focused dashboard ("BlockMint: Node Manager") designed exclusively for authorized server administrators of the BlockMint platform.

- **Sign-In Experience:**
  Only existing, authorized users can sign in using their credentials. There is no option to register or create a new account from within the app. All authentication is handled natively within the app, and no external browser is used except for social login, which now uses Safari View Controller on iOS as requested.

- **Account Deletion:**
  Users can now request account deletion directly from the app via the Settings page. This action is permanent and removes all user data from our servers and authentication provider. This complies with App Store Guideline 5.1.1(v).

- **Business Model:**
  1. Only authorized server administrators use the app.
  2. There are no paid subscriptions, features, or services in this app.
  3. No paid content or features are accessible in the app.
  4. No content is unlocked by any means other than administrator authorization.
  5. Accounts are provisioned by our IT team; users cannot create accounts or pay any fees via the app.
